# Quorum Permissioning Overview
Quorum supports two network permissioning models. 

* [Basic network permissioning](../Basic%20NetworkPermissions): Controls which nodes can connect to a given node and also to which nodes the given node can dial out to.

* [Enhanced network permissioning](../Enhanced%20Permissions%20Model/Overview): Caters for enterprise-level needs by having a **smart contract-based permissioning model**.  This allows for significant flexibility to manage nodes, accounts, and account-level access controls.
