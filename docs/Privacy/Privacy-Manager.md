# Privacy Manager

The Privacy Manager is a separate component that is concerned with the storing and distribution of encrypted private transaction data between recipients of a private transaction.

## Implementations
* [Tessera](../../Privacy/Tessera/Tessera) is a production-ready implementation of Quorum's privacy manager.  It is undergoing active development with new features being added regularly.

* [Constellation](../../Privacy/Constellation/Constellation) is the reference implementation of Quorum's privacy manager.  It is still supported but no longer undergoing active development of new features.  

## Lifecycle of a private transaction
See [How Tessera Works](../../Privacy/Tessera/How%20Tessera%20Works) for a description of the lifecycle of a private transaction.
